# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

Sentiment Analysis on User's Twitter Account to check whether their tweets are mostly positive, negative or neutral.

2 main python libraries used
- Tweepy - helps to access Twitter Api
- TextBlob - used to process the text and analyze sentiments out of it i.e. it is used to retrieve polarity and subjectivity.

To retrieve tweets from Twitter, Twitter Developer Account is required in which new app is created.

We have 4 keys for each app 
- api key
- api key secret
- access token
- access token secret

Using these keys, we can authenticate Twitter api using Tweepy api function.

For visualization - bar, scatter and pie charts used to plot sentiments using Matplotlib.

For front-end -> StreamLit is used.

Web App is deployed on Heroku.
